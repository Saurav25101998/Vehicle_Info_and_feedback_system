# Vehicle_Info_and_feedback_system
This project is done for my final year collage project.
VIFS is generally a very basic website of information of cars and a feedback form for the owner of vehicles.

Current features of VIFS are:-
1. Light weight design with a good structure of files.
2. Submission of form data in the database using XAMPP.
3. Seamless changing of webpages when clicking on any link.
4. Form validation is done through required attribute in the input element of html file.
   

Future goals related to this project:-
1. Integrate API for fetching data of all vehicle that users want to know about.
2. Make this website responsive.
3. Make form validation using javascript in detail.
4. Add some animations for interactive User-Interface.'
5. Give register and login facility for users.
