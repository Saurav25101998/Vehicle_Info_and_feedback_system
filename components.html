    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are seeing the different Parts of a car. Let us kow the basics of each part.</h3>

    <p><span>Lights :-</span> Tail lights work amazingly for safety purposes as well. They display the rear edge of an automobile that allows other drivers to properly measure the shape and size of the vehicle. In addition, they allow a driver to see the other vehicles on road in harsh weather conditions like rain or snow.</p>

    <p><span>Brakes :-</span> The purpose of the brake or brake system is to safely and reliably decelerate the vehicle, regardless of its speed. The brake also needs to keep the vehicle stationary when the driver is not there and when the vehicle is located on a slope.</p>

    <p><span>Fuel Filter :-</span> A fuel filter is located in the fuel line to screen out contaminants such as dirt, dust, debris and rust particles from the fuel. A fuel filter protects the critical parts of the engine, by filtering out foreign particles that can potentially damage a fuel injector.</p>

    <p><span>Exhaust System :-</span> The exhaust system collects the exhaust gases from the cylinders, removes harmful substances, reduces the level of noise and discharges the purified exhaust gases at a suitable point of the vehicle away from its occupants. The exhaust system can consist of one or two channels depending on the engine.</p>

    <p><span>Suspension :-</span> Suspension system is responsible for smoothing out the ride and keeping the car in control. Specifically, the suspension system maximizes the friction between the tires and the road to provide steering stability and good handling.</p>

    <p><span>Tyres</span> A tire has 3 basic functions: to carry, guide and transmit. Carry the load resulting from the weight of the vehicle and all the overloads linked to dynamic movements of the vehicle, together with any aerodynamic overloads at high speed, at the same time absorbing the irregularities in the road.</p>

    <p><span>Battery & Cable</span> An automotive battery, or car battery, is a rechargeable battery that is used to start a motor vehicle. Its main purpose is to provide an electric current to the electric-powered starting motor, which in turn starts the chemically-powered internal combustion engine that actually propels the vehicle.</p>

    <p><span>Air Filter :-</span> An engine air filter in your car filters out dirt, debris, and other particles that could harm the engine. An engine air filter's purpose is to ensure only clean air enters a car's engine. We talked to two car experts to learn how car engine air filters work and how to tell when they need to be changed.</p>

    <p><span>Transmission :-</span> In a car, a transmission, or a gearbox, acts as the medium that transmits power generated by the engine to the wheels via a mechanical system of gears and gear trains. A transmission allows a person to apply power to a vehicle in a controlled manner, without which, the car would not efficiently move.</p>

    <p><span>Engine Oil :-</span> Engine oil lubricates your engine's moving parts to reduce the damaging friction that reduces performance. Driving with low oil levels can significantly reduce the life of your vehicle. Clean oil also prevents the buildup of sludge which can clog the narrow oil passages in your engine.</p>

    <p><span>Sensors :-</span> The primary function of car sensors is to collect data and send them to the Electronic Control System (ECS). The ECS consists of algorithms which assist them in taking specific action in given scenario.</p>

    <p><span>Hoses :-</span> The hoses in your vehicle connect to the radiator, heater, fuel lines, vacuum lines, air conditioning, and power steering. Portions of hoses connected to the engine are flexible to absorb vibrations from the vehicle. Most often hoses will wear from the inside, appearing stable on the outside.</p>

    <p><span>Wind-Shield :-</span> They protect the driver and others in the vehicles from debris such as stones, dust and insects. They allow the car to be aerodynamic to reduce drag, improving the vehicle's efficiency. Without the use of the windows, a car would have to work twice as hard, wasting fuel at lower speeds.</p>

    <p><span>Belt :-</span> Serpentine belts, also known as drive belts, provide power to the air conditioning compressor, power steering pump, cooling fan, air injection pump, and more. If your vehicle's serpentine belt breaks, all of the engine parts it is powering will stop working, and your engine could overheat and be damaged.</p>

    <p><span>Spark Plug :-</span> Spark plugs function by producing a spark of electricity that ignites the air/fuel mixture within the engine. The spark plug has a small electrode at its tip connected to the ignition system. This electrode produces a spark of electricity that jumps across a small gap to the ground electrode when the engine is running.</p>

    <p><span>Steering Wheel :-</span> A steering wheel and the system it connects to primarily controls the direction of a vehicle. It converts rotational commands of the driver into swiveling movements of the vehicle's front wheels.</p>

    <p><span>Main Chassis :-</span>The chassis has a function to support the vehicle's engine and transmission loads as well as components and passengers in the car. Another function is to maintain the shape of the car so that it remains rigid and does not deform when used.</p>
